456,5QAO0mKFAKE,3.5: Using a simple raw TensorFlow.js pre-trained saved model in the browser,"Another way to use pre-made Web ML models Is simply just the raw trained model itself, with no JavaScript class wrapped around it that typically hides the inner workings, to make it easier to use for beginners. In this lesson you will learn to write the code to send data into the raw model, and then extract data from it yourself, using Tensors that you just learnt about in the prior lesson.

Individuals or researchers may share their raw models like this, which can be very useful for finding and using examples that may still be in development, or using models that solve less common problems, where an example may exist,
but does not have full documentation. Learn how to use raw pre-trained models from layers models to graph based models from any site including TensorFlow Hub - Google's model garden.

1. What exactly is the problem you are trying to solve?
2. Once you know the problem, what models do you know of that could assist you in solving this problem?
3. Considering all identified usable models, how do you select one to deliver the best solution?
Here we will cover concepts such as model size (both file size and RAM execution size), and model performance, along with other criteria to find the best model to choose.

Long-time C++ game engineer Scott Wardle finds an odd performance bug that inspires him to optimize Stadia Adventure server code. After getting stuck at first, he makes a model app to work out how to use Burst.CompileFunctionPointer, and get Unity‚Äôs Job System to run Managed C# code.  This optimizes the Stadia Adventure‚Äôs strangely slow server code finding a debugger bug along the way.

910,Tv68pdanovI,"Bridging traditional ""onprem"" game development with cloud workflows","The gaming industry is embracing the cloud. Like many industries it started with on-premise servers, then started to adopt Cloud providers to run their work loads. While some game teams are already quite invested in running on the cloud, other are still discovering the good, the bad and the ugly of adopting Cloud. We'll go over some of the key differences between running your game studio using on-premise hardware and creating a cloud native studio.

914,jx7JjU98NzQ,Integrating DEI into the game development process,"How do we create a sense of belonging in video games? The industry does not yet have a consistent and actionable way to evaluate how well games align with the needs of diverse and underrepresented players. 
At Stadia Games and Entertainment, we answered this challenge by developing a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) rubric for our game development process. We walk through the process of creating, using, and sharing the rubric to promote Product Inclusion and DEI in gaming. A key focus is on equipping video game professionals to set up similar processes at their organizations to meaningfully integrate DEI as a core part of the development and game evaluation process.

So we focused on improving our tools and building programs like Stadia Makers to allow us to work with more developers and bring your awesome games to Stadia. In this talk, we give an overview of the Makers program, the benefits for developers, criteria for having your game considered, share feedback from our first Stadia Makers devs, and tell you how to apply and have your game considered.

1. Flutter 1.0
Flutter is very much already in full swing, as you may already know. The primary focus of this release is bug fixes and stabilization, but it also includes a few new things like Dart 2.1 and previews for ""Add to App"" and ""Platform Views""

2. Square SDKs for Flutter
Square is making it easy to accept payments for goods and services with Flutter both in-person with a Square payment reader, as well as from inside your mobile app.

3. 2Dimensions Flare
2Dimensions has launched Flare! It's a tool that allows you to create vector animations that can be embedded into an existing Flutter app as a widget. It's a really tight integration that supports ongoing collaboration between designers and developers throughout the build process.

4. Codemagic 
With Codemagic (made by Nevercode) you can select a GitHub repo with a Flutter project and quickly create continuous build flows that runs tests and generate binary app bundles that you can upload to the Apple App Store and Google Play store.

5. Hummingbird
Hummingbird is an experimental web-based implementation of the Flutter runtime. With it, you can write your app in Dart and, in addition to compiling to native ARM code, you can also target JavaScript, which enables your Flutter code to run on the standards-based web.

1. Performance budgets and updates to speed tooling
Since 2011, we‚Äôve seen sites use an average 8x more JavaScript - the site performance bottleneck now often includes the CPU. Using a budget metaphor is a useful tool to help keep resource spending under control. Additionally, the Chrome team has brought in a complete refresh to PageSpeedInsights.

2. Squoosh.app
It can be very challenging to build complex web applications and keep them fast, fluid and lightweight. But there are tools and techniques available now that can help. Squoosh.app is a demo app that showcases techniques and technology available that can help make a complex experience smooth.

3. Web.Dev
Moving away from providing guidance through walls of text, we‚Äôve taken the approach of short, snappy guides providing support for developers.

4. Project vis bug
Project vis bug is a new Chrome extension thinking about design on the web.

5. Closer collaboration with Web Frameworks
Frameworks made a lot of important performance improvements in 2018 - amplify their impact by helping design various APIs - including the Scheduling API - offering 200k in funding for improving performance best practices in frameworks

They remove the new keyword everywhere, delete unused files, and re-enable unit tests.

Then they set out to tackle state management and separation of concerns between view logic and business logic. They choose to follow the BLoC pattern, using Streams and ReactiveX (rxdart).

With that in place, they implement a new feature: ability to switch between the listing of top and new stories.

But the tools for developing machine learning systems have not yet undergone a corresponding transformation away from conventional programming paradigms. In this talk, we will explore a framework for reconceptualizing software development tools around the experiential nature of learning machines and the multimedia data they learn from and interact with. We will look for common ground between the ways that humans and machines think and learn in order to build tools that will help people from a range of backgrounds and professional interests to extend their reach through the aid of machine intelligence.

It has been shown that intelligibility can help users interact with a system more effectively, promote positive attitudes towards the system, increase their trust in the system's decisions and actions, and to gain a sense of controllability. My research has focused on providing explanations ‚Äì textual and graphical ‚Äì of the behaviour of intelligent systems to make these systems more intelligible. In this talk I will provide a brief overview of what we know about how to design for intelligibility so that users understand how an intelligent system works.

1405,ThKvlgnLyDk,Asynchronous messages in Hangouts Chat,"Hangouts Chat is more than just a messaging tool for user communication. It features a bot framework allowing developers to build bots that can retrieve information, automate tasks, or perform other heavy-lifting for users. While bots can respond synchronously to user requests, there are situations where asynchronous messages are needed. These include notifying users when long-running jobs have completed, alerts such as when a server goes down or when a new customer is added to the database. In this video, engineer Wesley Chun shows viewers the different ways the framework supports asynchronous messages and shows you how to use them.

This video is also subtitled in Chinese, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.

1563,TF1yh5PKaqI,Getting Started with Weka - Machine Learning Recipes #10,"Hey everyone! In this video, I‚Äôll walk you through using Weka - The very first machine learning library I‚Äôve ever tried. What‚Äôs great is that Weka comes with a GUI that makes it easy to visualize your datasets, and train and evaluate different classifiers. I‚Äôll give you a quick walkthrough of the tool, from installation all the way to running experiments, and show you some of what it can do. This is a helpful library to have while you‚Äôre learning ML, and I still find it useful today to experiment with new datasets. Note: In the video, I quickly went through testing. This is an important topic in ML, and how you design and evaluate your experiments is even more important than the classifier you use. Although I publish these videos at turtle speed, I‚Äôve started working on an experimental design one, and that‚Äôll be next! Also, we will soon publish some testing tips and best practices on tensorflow.org (https://goo.gl/nZcS5R).

1574,EJpKnEHc5Z0,Integrate a single AdMob mediation partner into an app,"If you're an AdMob publisher building with Unity, you know that putting AdMob mediation to work in Unity apps can be tricky. Not only are there two different platforms to deal with (and therefore two SDKs, two adapters, and so on), but many things that are simple on Android and iOS, like passing mediation extras, are tricky to do from C#.

Recently, however, the Mobile Ads team began rolling out network-specific Unity packages for AdMob mediation that contains the libraries and code needed to integrate a single AdMob mediation partner into an app. Now, rather than modifying gradle files by hand, downloading iOS frameworks, writing custom extras code, and so on, publishers can just import a Unity package and have what they need to start mediating a new network.

In this episode of Mobile Ads Garage, you'll get a breakdown of how this works, plus see screencasts of some of the packages in action.

This video is also subtitled in Vietnamese, Thai, Korean, Japanese, Indonesian, Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan).

1647,_Hg_v2AG7Lw,What are AdMob Rewarded Videos?,"It used to be that AdMob publishers who wanted to use rewarded video ads were forced to use mediation to source their ads from third party networks.

Publishers can load and show rewarded video directly from Google's network of advertisers with no third party SDKs or mediation adapters required.

In this video, you'll learn what makes rewarded stand out from other formats, how it can fit into your apps and games, plus see full implementation screencasts in iOS and Android.

Maya Gupta, Seungil You and Jan Pfeifer introduce TensorFlow Lattice. TensorFlow Lattice is an open source project that provides a set of prebuilt TensorFlow Estimators that are easy to use, and TensorFlow operators to build your own lattice models. Lattices are multi-dimensional interpolated look-up tables that can approximate any input-output relationships in your data. Furthermore, TensorFlow Lattice provides a way to impose a monotonic input-output relationship (an input goes up, then the output goes up) and smooth regularizers including Laplacian, Torsion to help your model generalize better for unseen feature space.

1728,Qd64idiKZWw,Modifying events with the Google Calendar API,"Developers may be aware they can use email markup or the Google Calendar API in their apps to insert events into their users‚Äô calendars. This gives users a better experience because they no longer have to enter event details into their calendars manually. While this is good news, it‚Äôs only the first step. Developers should also enable their apps to be able to modify those events in case plans change, and they always do. While you can update events using markup, it‚Äôs limited as far as what you can do, so this video shows developers how to use the Calendar API to modify events, including the creation of repeating events.

Cory Diers introduces Blockly for visual programming. Blockly is a developer library that makes it easy to add, drag and drop block editor to any app on web, iOS, or Android. The editor represents coding concepts as interlocking blocks that users can drag around and quickly snap together. It outputs syntactically correct code in the language of your choice. Custom blocks may be created to connect to your own application.
 
You can read more on Blockly's developer docs or start hacking by downloading the web, iOS, or Android libraries from GitHub. For a more guided introduction, check out the iOS Codelab.

1853,W421BNZA_74,Using field masks with update requests to Google APIs,"In this conclusion of our two-part series on field masks, engineer Wesley Chun shows viewers how to use field masks with update API requests. In the previous episode, you learned that when reading data from an API, field masks can be used as a ‚Äúpartial response‚Äù mechanism to control the amount of data that comes back in the response payload. For update requests, field masks have a different responsibility: to tell the API exactly which fields should be set (and perhaps which should be reset). We‚Äôll conclude with tips to remember when using field masks for either API request type, including a double example where field masks not only designate values to update but also control the data returned in the API response. Also featured are JavaScript & Python code snippets for using field masks with the Google Sheets & Slides APIs.

SDK Support Forum: https://goo.gl/MJfJ9N

After hearing from publishers that you'd like a smoother path to integrating mediation, AdMob has worked with a bunch of network partners to open the source for their mediation adapters. This has a few key benefits. First, there are now two repositories on GitHub with adapter source that publishers can use as an additional resource. Second, it allows AdMob to take those adapters up to bintray, where they can be targeted with jCenter packages and CocoaPods. That means that instead of hunting down individual JAR files, publishers can simply add a line to their podfile or build.gradle, and get the adapter they need!

Included in this video is a breakdown of the new resources, as well as screencasts of Android Studio and Xcode that show how to import adapters for several networks.

This video is subtitled in Vietnamese, Thai, Korean, Japanese, Indonesian, Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan).

While the Mobile Ads SDK has supported rewarded video ads for a while now, publishers have needed to use mediation in their integrations. Now, however, AdMob has launched its own rewarded video demand, which means publishers can get ads directly from AdMob, no mediation required.

In this episode, we'll cover how to take advantage of these new ads in Unity. In addition to the APIs for Android, iOS, and C++, AdMob maintains an open source plugin for Unity developers. With its consistent C# interface, publishers can code once and deploy for both Android and iOS devices. In this episode, you'll see how to import the plugin, how to request ads, and how to use C# events to tap into the rewarded video ad lifecycle.

One of the best practices for creating great slide decks is to minimize the amount of text. That means that if you DO have text, the words you use must have higher impact AND be visually appealing. In this video, Google engineer Wesley Chun shows developers a variety of ways to format all those important words in your presentations using the Google Slides API.

1978,h2_oiGv3ZdQ,Generating slides from spreadsheet data,"Spreadsheets are a great utility in the business world, a virtual swiss army knife for what they can do with data, turning it into information. While presentations aren't able to manipulate data in the way a spreadsheet can, they do take information & make it more visually appealing & more easily understood by human beings. In this video, Google engineer Wesley Chun shows you how to import spreadsheet data into presentations by using both the Google Sheets and Slides APIs. With these APIs, you can develop powerful apps that can automate this process between both types of apps so users no longer have to do this by hand.

SDK Support Forum: https://goo.gl/MJfJ9N


Knowing what's going on with the ads in your app is a big part of maintaining a great user experience. Your app needs to be aware of when they've loaded, when the user has tapped on one to open it, and a number of other lifecycle events.


In this episode, we introduce you to the ad lifecycle and the listeners and delegates that help you tap into it. You'll learn what happens when, and which callbacks to use for things like pausing CPU-intensive tasks (read: game engines), muting audio, loading fresh ads, and so on. We're also breaking in a new format for going over code, so let us know what you think in the comments!

This time, we‚Äôll write a basic one using TF.Learn. To make it easier for you to try this out, I wrote a Jupyter Notebook for this episode -- https://goo.gl/NNlMNu -- and I‚Äôll start with a quick screencast of installing TensorFlow using Docker, and serving the notebook. This is a great way to get all the dependencies installed and properly configured. I've linked some additional notebooks below you can try out, too. Next, I‚Äôll start introducing a linear classifier. My goal here is just to get us started. I‚Äôd like to spend a lot more time on this next episode, if there‚Äôs interest? I have a couple alternate ways of introducing them that I think would be helpful (and I put some exceptional links below for you to check out to learn more, esp. Colah's blog and CS231n - wow!). Finally, I‚Äôll show you how to reproduce those nifty images of weights from TensorFlow.org's Basic MNIST‚Äôs tutorial.

2083,3yUZ3bCuKv0,Introduction to Hands Free Payments,"Hands Free is a way to pay for items at participating stores without taking out your wallet or your phone. To get started with Hands Free, all you need to do is download the Hands Free app and set up your profile (photo, name, and payment method). When you tell the cashier, ‚ÄúI'll pay with Google,‚Äù the cashier can look you up on their point-of-sale system and charge your account. To confirm that you‚Äôre at the store where you‚Äôre making the purchase, Hands Free uses Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi, location services, and other signals from your phone.

In this video, Aston Lau introduces Hands Free payments and explains how a merchant can integrate it into their POS using the Hands Free API.

2117,yJVkdsZc9YA,VR Distortion Correction Using Vertex Displacement for Cardboard Apps - Google I/O 2016,"Lenses make VR possible. They allow us to look at a screen a few inches from our eyes, but feel like we're looking out across a vast virtual landscape. Unfortunately, they also warp our view of the virtual world, distortions that require expensive, per-pixel computations to correct. This talk describes a technique for performing these computations per vertex, removing the need for traditional full-screen render textures and massively improving mobile performance, which is particularly well suited to Cardboard VR apps.

2128,r-HlJyNWfoY,"reCAPTCHA: Tough on Bots, Easy on Humans, Great on Mobile - Google I/O 2016","Spammy traffic consumes resources and degrades the user experience. This has long been a problem on desktop and is even worse on mobile. CAPTCHAs have traditionally been the first line of defense for fighting automated spam and abuse. However, as spammers have grown more sophisticated, the increased complexity of CAPTCHAs can be frustrating for end users, resulting in increased drop-offs.

Google‚Äôs reCAPTCHA API has been on a mission to change this by providing an effective spam & abuse fighting tool with minimal user interaction. In this talk, we will introduce an updated UI and discuss a broad set of reCAPTCHA use cases. We give a sneak peek into the machinery behind our spam and abuse fighting, and end with a demo of how easy it is to integrate reCAPTCHA into your site or app.

2149,tE1j_zzIgCA,Election 2016: The big data showdown - Google I/O 2016,"The US election is still months away, but a massive amount of data has already been generated on the topic. From social media to campaign finance disclosures to newspaper articles to poll results, we are awash in data about the candidates. How can we separate the signal from the noise, and figure out what it all means?

This talk takes a number of disparate sources of data; reddit comments, federal election disclosures, and a global event database as the raw materials to use Dataflow, Datalab, Cloud ML, and BigQuery, to extract meaning from it all. We find out what people are saying, in real-time, about the candidates. We show how to build a dashboard that can display front-runners in the campaign donation race, the reddit popularity contest, and more. 

Learn how to set up BigQuery and re:dash to analyze the elections: https://goo.gl/VFWJKV

You'll see how you, too, can gain insight from disparate data sources by harnessing the suite of tools in Google's cloud.

2217,mnA0gaQWtAM,Implementing Android In-App Billing -  The Zen of Monetization #7,"Neto Marin explains how to implement the In-App Billing API V3 in your Android app. In-app Billing on Google Play provides a straightforward, simple interface for sending In-app Billing requests and managing In-app Billing transactions using Google Play. In-app billing relies on the Google Play application, which handles all communication between your application and the Google Play server. You can use the service to sell a wide range of content, including downloadable content such as media files or photos, virtual content such as game levels or potions, premium services and features, and more.

This video covers how to your existing app or how to create a new project to support the In-App Billing API, how to connect to the Google Play service, list product details, start a purchase or subscription flow, and how to handle API responses.

2224,ubznpe3MUF0,Is your app in the Google index?,"Get your app in the Google index ‚Äî and be ready for the future of search! Try the hands-on codelab at: https://goo.gl/I6RVxP

In 1998, Google set out to index the web and make content easily accessible and discoverable. Today mobile app adoption is growing rapidly and we‚Äôre bringing the same accessibility and discoverability to apps. App Indexing is the ability for Google to index apps just like websites. Deep links to your Android app appear in Google Search results so users can get to your native mobile experience quickly, landing exactly on the right content within the app.

Drive return visits to your app

ÔøºÔøºFor users who have your app installed, having deep links appear in search results will help drive organic traffic back to your app.

Re-engage your users

For users who have viewed pages in your app, and later searches for similar content, you can use the App Indexing API to have deep links appear in search suggestions. For example, a user visits a pizza restaurant page in an app. The next time the user searches for pizza, a deep link will appear in search suggestions before seeing search results.

Create a seamless experience for your users 

App indexing is flexible‚Äîyou can direct search users to your app or website on a page by page basis. Moving from search results to apps is seamless, without any pop-ups or extra taps to slow users down.

2312,d8EvXtz2uiA,Google Genomics: Running Picard with GA4GH Apis,"Picard/GATK tools are command line utilities for genomic sequencing data processing that typically take BAM and other files as input and produce modified BAM files.

These tools are frequently chained together into pipelines to perform step-by-step processing of the sequencing data all the way from unaligned sequencer output to variant calls (e.g. see Broad best practices).

We are teaching these tools to take cloud based datasets as a possible input. The foundation for cloud data access is now in HTSJDK library and we have converted a number of Picard tools.

If your dataset is loaded into a cloud provider supporting GA4GH API (e.g. Google Genomics) or you use one of the available datasets from Discover Published Data, you will be able to run a Picard tool against it, reading data directly from the cloud.

In this video we walk through running Picard tool processing data from the cloud via GA4GH Api implemented by Google Genomics.

See http://googlegenomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/use_cases/run_picard_and_gatk/",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d8EvXtz2uiA/default.jpg,2016-01-07

2332,nEfSOjIpLJA,Google Cast Remote Display Plugin,"Unity Developers can take advantage of the Google Cast Remote Display API to extend their games onto a TV by use of the Google Cast Remote Display Plugin for Unity.

The plugin supports games built for iOS as well as Android.

This video shows a walk through of the Android based code lab available to teach how to integrate Google Cast Remote Display for Unity based games. The full code lab is available at https://www.code-labs.io/codelabs/cast-unity-plugin/ for developers to try.

The Google Cast Remote Display API allows developers to leverage the GPU power in mobile devices to render high frame-rate, responsive gaming and send it to a TV for large screen display. Using the Unity plugin simplifies the integration effort significantly and makes it easy to build a Google Cast enabled game.

For more information about the Google Cast Remote Display API, see https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/remote and take a look at the Game Manager API https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/gaming which makes it easy to build multi-player gaming experiences.

2397,cKIVdzCf8ic,Launchpad Online: Automating YouTube stats with Google Apps Script,"Have you ever been asked by your boss to do something simple but long and tedious, such as counting up the view counts for your corporate videos and your competitors'? What about outside of work where you and your gamer friends are competing to see whose replay clips get the most views? This is a boring task that's easily processed from a Google Sheets spreadsheet with the help of Google Apps Script and the YouTube Data API.

In this Launchpad Online episode, Google engineer Wesley Chun (http://google.com/+WesleyChun) and special guests propose a scenario that may not be so different from real life including a line-by-line code walkthough that can get you started building a solution in JavaScript that will make your boss' (and you) happy!

2428,TfbEwfYjKl4,Learn how to scale your applications with Google Compute Engine (100 Days of Google Dev),"Google Compute Engine offers automatic scaling and load balancing so that your applications can easily respond and handle increases or decreases in traffic. This is the same technology used by Google, and its powerful features are now available to Google Compute Engine users. This video describes both autoscaling and load balancing, sets up a common scenario, and lastly, demonstrates how to use each service.

At some point in your application development, you will start to think about scaling your application so that it can respond quickly and appropriately to your customer requests, without overloading your virtual machine instances. Use load balancing so that you can distribute traffic to your application among groups of virtual machines, optimizing for network, region, or content-based load balancing. Set up autoscaling so that Compute Engine monitors traffic to your application and can make logical decisions to add or remove instances from your cluster, so that you can respond to heavy traffic, or reduce costs in times of lower traffic.

2439,O9GaTDZ7fWw,Managing Beacons with the Proximity Beacon API (100 Days of Google Dev),"As a follow up to his previous video on using Nearby Messages with Beacons (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7InjJGqP15E), Marc Wandschneider introduces the new Proximity Beacon APIs to show how to register beacons and prepare them for subscription via Nearby Messages. Nearby is a new API that enables your device to react to nearby objects and micro-locations such as bus stops, train platforms, or even indoor locations such as exhibits in a museum. BLE beacons -- such as those that support Eddystone, an open beacon format from Google -- can be an important source of information about these locations.

Using beacons with the Nearby Messages API is a fairly straightforward process that requires only a few steps: Gather your beacons, register them and attach message data with the Proximity Beacon API, and then register with Nearby Messages to receive notifications based on sightings of these beacons. Then the sky‚Äôs the limit for what your applications can do with this information.

2461,2TUvmlGoDrw,Smaller PNG Files (100 Days of Google Dev),"PNG files represent the bulk of android image content, especially if you‚Äôve got a lot of UI elements in your application (rather than photo data). But PNG files also represent a huge problem in terms of file size; They are easy to bloat, and too often, we don‚Äôt give them enough attention to make them smaller. 

As Colt McAnlis, explains, shrinking PNG files is a problem that‚Äôs been solved for a long time now. There‚Äôs a federation of tools out there which only focus on improving & compressing PNG files even further than you get out of your photo editing tools.

Developers who can harness the raw power of these savings can find themselves with smaller images that are cheaper to transfer, and faster to download.

2475,1WqcEHXRWpM,Smaller Pixel Formats (100 Days of Google Dev),"Compressed image formats like PNG, JPG and WebP do a fantastic job of reducing the file size of your images for distribution & transfer. But once your images get off of the disk, and into memory, all those great compression savings, disappear. And serious application developers know that smaller images don‚Äôt have to stop with disk formats. 

Follow along as Colt McAnlis describes how to reduce your bitmap memory woes with the help of some of Android's not-so-obvious compressed pixel formats. Each one reduces the bits needed, per pixel, to produce a smaller memory footprint. But be careful, each one also reduces the visual quality of your image, so it‚Äôs important to understand what format, is best for what situation.

2481,7InjJGqP15E,Using Nearby with Beacons (100 days of Google Dev),"Marc Wandschneider walks through the steps necessary to use the Nearby Messages API with beacons. Nearby Messages is a new API that enables your device to react to nearby objects and micro-locations such as bus stops, train platforms, or even indoor locations such as exhibits in a museum. BLE beacons -- such as those that support Eddystone, an open beacon format from Google -- can be an important source of information about these locations.

Using beacons with the Nearby Messages API is a fairly straightforward process that requires only a few steps: Gather your beacons, register them and attach message data with the Proximity Beacon API, and then register with Nearby Messages to receive messages based on sightings of these beacons. Then the sky‚Äôs the limit for what your applications can do with this information.

2534,wCNyuLdwUxI,Google Search for Developers (100 Days of Google Dev),"Vivian Lum provides an update on new features available on Google Search for Developers that can help developers grow their userbase and get more engaged users.  2 simple steps to follow are: 

Get found on Google -- Developers can integrate with App Indexing to get their app content found on Google, whether they have developed on Android or iOS.  If they have a mobile website, they can optimize and make it Mobile-friendly by following our updated webmaster guidelines.  

Promote content and capabilities of your site and/or app -- Developers can declare capabilities of their apps to Google through a variety of annotations. For example, Watch Action allows TV publishers to declare streamable content to Google, so Google can in turn help users discover and consume the content from their apps.  With Voice Messaging API, users can activate an app‚Äôs messaging capability with voice, and interact with the app through the app‚Äôs integration with Voice Interaction API.

Whether your app uses system or custom voice actions (https://g.co/VoiceActions), there might be times when the app would like to ask the user a follow-up question before performing the action. For example, after a music app launches when a user says ‚Äúplay some music‚Äù, it may want to ask the user ‚Äúwhat genre?‚Äù Or when a home automation app hears the user say ‚ÄúOK Google, turn on the lights‚Äù, it might want to ask ‚Äúwhich room?‚Äù The Voice Interaction API lets Android M apps ask follow-up questions like these.

It's the same Google Maps platform you already use for phones and tablets. This experience has been enhanced to take into account of the Android Wear form factor and design conventions.

Using the Maps API is easy. Developers can put either a MapView or a MapFragment and go from there. Compelling use cases include: local travel app, exercise app. Another way that the Maps API can help the user is by marking a greeting location on a map for a friend, a taxi or hired car driver. To do this, developers can use the CameraLocation attached to the map.

For detailed step-by-step implementations, developers can check out the Maps APIs on Android Wear blog post. Android Wear is for users on the move, so let‚Äôs keep those users moving!

2586,R5ON3iwx78M,The Magic of LRU Cache (100 Days of Google Dev),"Here‚Äôs a common problem that I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve run into: It‚Äôs time to load a new bitmap for your apps‚Äô social media stream, or whatever, but you're out of memory.  You can‚Äôt load in the new bitmap, without first destroying one of the existing bitmaps already in memory. But, which one should you get rid of?

Well, as Colt McAnlis, points out, you could learn 60 years of history of Cache replacement algorithms; that‚Äôll help.. or, you could just use Android‚Äôs LRUCache container.

This container keeps a list of objects, and ranks them based upon how many times they‚Äôve been accessed. When it‚Äôs time to evict one of them (to make space for a new object) the LRUCache already knows which ones to get rid of. All done without you having to worry about any of it.

(We mean this more literally than you might think‚Ä¶) Our goal: break the tension between the ever-shrinking screen sizes necessary to make electronics wearable and our ability to have rich interactions with them. Why can‚Äôt you have both? We like to build new things. Sometimes seemingly impossible things. We can build them faster together.

2602,DIMqIGax8Co,Google I/O 2015 - Helping Moonshots Survive Contact with the Real World,"Speaker(s):
Astro Teller

Description:
Venture inside Google[x] for an in-depth conversation with Astro Teller, Captain of Moonshots, who will discuss one of the hardest parts of the innovation process -- the part where you come into contact with the real world, and learn what's wrong with what you√ïve done so far. He'll explain why failure is so important to the innovation process at Google[x], and how we relentlessly seek out contact with the harsh realities of weather, physics, humanity, and much more, because so much of what we have to learn can't be predicted by a book, taught in school or observed in a lab. He'll illustrate this by sharing hard-earned lessons from Project Loon, the self-driving car, Makani and more.

Alex Faaborg; Erica Morse; Jon Wiley; Manuel Clement

Description:
Designing great user experiences in virtual reality is considerably different than designing for the more traditional 2D form factors that you may be familiar with. Virtual reality introduces a new set of physiological and ergonomic considerations to your design work. Additionally, as a new medium users may not have established a familiarity with interacting with virtual reality applications yet. And with an infinite canvas inside of your application, there are some very real challenges with guiding the user√çs focus and attention. We√çll review common interactive patterns for virtual reality applications that work well. We'll also discuss best practices for rapid prototyping in virtual reality, and what the Google VR design team has learned from crafting virtual reality applications.

The API provides the app full control on the user experience and the UI2. Confirm Device Credential API - allows apps to create a hardware bound cryptographic objects and tie those to lock screen. It allows the app to define a policy to access those keys (‚Äúe.g., did user unlock in the last 10 minutes‚Äù), and sync those timeout across the system. The two APIs provide apps both convenience and security, and it is up to the app to decide which solution fits him best. To try the APIs please download Android M preview release.

2637,bSOREVMEFnM,Object Pools (Android Performance Patterns Season 2 ep5),"Memory Churn is a constant, and serious problem for the performance of your applications. Allocating loads of temporary objects in a short time frame puts a ton of pressure on your memory heaps, resulting in more GC events being kicked off. 

In this video Colt McAnlis, provides a recipe for success here: Rather than promoting a bulk of your objects to static in order to solve memory churn problems, you can utilize an amazingly powerful data structure, known as an Object Pool.

Object Pools are data structures which hold on to un-used objects for you. Basically, rather than freeing an object back to the heap when you‚Äôre done with it, you instead, hand it off to the object pool. Later on, when some function wants a new object of that type, you can return the un-used object, rather than going and allocating a new one from the heap.

2672,kazpTc75-Bg,Space Frugal Reflection (Dart Developer Summit 2015),"Dynamic languages define the culture of web programming, and Dart web programming tends to use reflection. However, static analysis of reflection is difficult, and hence very little can be omitted from programs via tree shaking during compilation. Consequently, the size of dart2js-generated code causes performance problems during software download and startup. Reflectable is an upcoming package with a transformer that empowers programmers to statically specify how they use reflection, based on metadata. Reflection can then be avoided entirely; it is replaced by a statically generated, customized version of the reflection library, resulting in a considerably smaller compiler output.

2678,U9Cl-c-BXhk,Android Wear Data Batching (Android Performance Patterns Season 2 ep4),"Writing fast and battery-friendly phone apps is essential for making users happy. But for Android Wear, it is absolutely critical. In this video, Wayne Piekarski shows you some simple tricks to batch up your Android Wear data transfers, helping to make your wearable apps more battery efficient. 

Some of the most important ideas are:
- Only requesting network updates when you are certain there might be a change
- Process received data on the phone to minimize content sent to the Android Wear device
- Only send updates to the wearable when things have actually changed
- Combine multiple pieces of data together into single items to minimize protocol overheads
- Put as much code on the phone side as you can, the watch is only used for information presentation and simple user interaction

Whether your app uses the accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, hardware-accelerated step sensor, or more, the sensors on Android‚Äôs newest wearable can give you more accurate and personalized information than ever before. 

Good practices for using sensors on Android are critical to battery life on Android Wear.  If you‚Äôre careless with how you use the sensors, you can eat up battery life -- leaving you with an app that no one likes!  In this video, Lisa Wray breaks down the best practices to use the sensors on Android Wear with new performance tips ‚Äì and a few important reminders ‚Äì so you can surprise and delight your users all day long.

2680,fEEulSk1kNY,Battery Drain and Networking (Android Performance Patterns Season 2 ep1),"Let‚Äôs take a moment to make something insanely clear: As far as battery is concerned, NETWORKING is the biggest, baddest, dirtiest offender there is. And optimizing performance here isn‚Äôt easy. Since the chip isn‚Äôt always awake and draining power, means you can optimize how it wakes up, sends traffic, and saves battery. 

As Colt McAnlis describes, batching and delaying your content isn‚Äôt always the easiest thing, which is why the JobScheduler API, alongside the BatteryHistorian tool are essential to finding areas that need improvment, fixing them, and saving your users‚Äô precious battery.

2763,e5YDb-XnDVk,Introducing the Google Maps Platform Roads API,"Mobile apps need accurate visualization of actual roads travelled.

The Google Maps Roads API lets you send a bunch of GPS coordinates collected from your mobile phone to Google‚Äôs servers and get returned coordinates that snap to roads - letting you create a more accurate visualization of journeys your device has been traveling.

By detecting noisy GPS coordinates and discarding them, as well as providing interpolated intermediate points, the returned coordinates can more accurately represent the actual path you‚Äôve been traversing.

Mobile apps need to conserve battery power, and reducing GPS sample rates is a good way to reduce power consumption, but if the number of samples gets too low to trace an accurate path, the Roads API lets a mobile app reproduce the actual path travelled without the penalty of power consumption from too much polling.

2791,2s7UAscFUDw,Easy Maps Apps in Java and Python,"Integrating Google Maps API services into applications provides a great set of location based services for powerful functionality. If you write server side applications in Java or Python, accessing these APIs requires some way to talk to the Google Maps server REST APIs that provide the interfaces.

Google have built an open-source set of client libraries that take care of all the nitty-gritty detail of connecting, and managing Maps API services for both Java and Python.

Alex Danilo introduces these libraries, and what they do  - allowing Java and Python server side application developers to save time integrating Maps API services into their applications.

These libraries streamline and simplify the work required to get an application up and running by taking care of things like retry for dropped connections, rate limiting to make sure applications manage their quota, and more.

Documentation for the client libraries is on the Google Developers Site here, and the open source project code is on github here.

If you develop in Java or Python, you should definitely take a look.

For example, needing to allocate more bitmaps for your social media data;Or plotting a new jogging path that takes your user past a trendy donut shop. What‚Äôs tricky though, is seeing how these allocations, can impact your performance.

2794,1iaHxmfZGGc,Android Performance Patterns: Understanding VSYNC,"Unbeknown to most developers, there‚Äôs a simple hardware design that defines everything about how fast your application can draw things to the screen.

You may have heard the term VSYNC - VSYNC stands for vertical synchronization and it's an event that happens every time your screen starts to refresh the content it wants to show you.

Effectively, VSYNC is the product of two components Refresh Rate (how fast the hardware can refresh the screen), and Frames Per Second (how fast the GPU can draw images), and in this video +Colt McAnlis walks through each of these topics, and discusses where VSYNC (and the 16ms rendering barrier) comes from, and why it‚Äôs critical to understand if you want a silky smooth application.

2795,T52v50r-JfE,Android Performance Patterns: Understanding Overdraw,"One of the most problematic performance problems on Android is the easiest to create; thankfully, it‚Äôs also easy to fix.

OVERDRAW is a term used to describe how many times a pixel has been re-drawn in a single frame of rendering. It‚Äôs a troublesome issue, because in most cases, pixels that are overdrawn do not end up contributing to the final rendered image. As such, it amounts to wasted work for your GPU and CPU. 

Fixing overdraw has everything to do with using the available on-device tools, like Show GPU Overdraw, and then adjusting your view hierarchy in order to reduce areas where it may be occurring.

In this video, +Colt McAnlis runs through the problem, takes a look at the tools, and talks about some great ways to solve this issue in your own application.

2796,WH9AFhgwmDw,Android Performance Patterns: Android UI and the GPU,"One of the most challenging questions for Android Developers is ‚Äúhow does your activity actually get drawn to the screen?‚Äù Or rather, how does all that crazy XML and markup language turn into pixels that the user can see and understand?

At its core, this is done with a process known as ‚ÄúRasterization‚Äù, and for most android devices, there‚Äôs a special piece of hardware dedicated to performing this task. Which is great, since it tends to be a heavy and slow process. One down-side though, is that getting this piece of hardware to work right, and performant, all the time, means making a lot of tradeoffs in flexibility and design.

In this video, Colt McAnlis introduces how the GPU fits into Android‚Äôs rendering system, and talks about the complexities you should know about in order to ensure that your system is always running fast and smooth.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WH9AFhgwmDw/default.jpg,2015-01-06

In this Android Performance Patterns episode, Colt McAnlis walks you through how the human visual system works from 10 to 60 frames per second (fps), why 60 fps is the perfect target to aim for to ensure a seamless experience for your app users, and how developers have 16.666 ms/ frame to do all of their work.

But that might be a bit more difficult than you think.

In this video, +Colt McAnlis takes a look at what ‚Äúrendering performance‚Äù means to developers, alongside some of the most common pitfalls that are ran into; and let‚Äôs not forget the important stuff: the tools that help you track down, and fix these issues before they become large problems.

2874,ctiaVxgclsg,DevBytes: Introduction to Android Auto,"Timothy Jordan Introduces Android Auto.  Android Auto brings the Android platform to the car in a way that's optimized for the driving experience. It's the same Google platform you already use for phones, tablets, televisions, watches, and more.  In fact, all these experiences will often be in the same APK. But now, your app can also extend to the car in a way that's safer and more efficient for the driver. So drivers can stay connected with their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road.

Using Android Auto is easy. Users go to the Google Play store and download apps that support Android Auto onto their phone..  When they connect their phone to the car, the phone goes into car mode and casts the Android Auto experience to the car's screen. This means that although all the apps and services are actually running on the phone, they're displayed in the car's dash. Users interact with them using the vehicle's controls such as a built-in touchscreen and microphone.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ctiaVxgclsg/default.jpg,2014-11-18

2932,fapiebSfsPM,Welcome to Polytechnic with Eric Bidelman,"Starting in November, we‚Äôve asked for Google Developer Groups from all around the world to host their own Polymer events, which we‚Äôre calling ‚ÄúPolytechnics‚Äù.

Generally, a Polytechnic will include a tech talk, self-guided code labs, and free time for hacking. We want attendees to come away feeling like they know the basics of working with Polymer, and excited to start experimenting with it in their own projects. All of the necessary materials to run your own Polytechnic (speaker deck, training video, code labs, graphic assets, etc) are available now at the official site: itshackademic.com.

Web Components are still a very new thing, so it‚Äôs up to all of us, as a community, to grow this ecosystem, and help others get started. To find a Polytechnic near you, take a look at the event map, where new events are being added every day. If you don‚Äôt see an event in your area, reach our to your local GDG lead to see if they can help you get one up and running. Also, be sure to spread the word with the #itshackademic hashtag!

Google Fit is an open fitness ecosystem that provides developers with a single set of APIs to discover, record, store, and read activity data with user permission. The Fit APIs for Android are bundled in Google Play Services -- making them compatible with Android devices back to API level 9 (Gingerbread) -- and backed by a cloud datastore.  Google Fit is also accessible by a REST API.  

This DevByte is the second of two parts.  In the first, we connected to Google Fit for Android and used the Sensors API.  In this DevByte, we use the Recording API and the History API to record, retrieve, and display the user's fitness data.  Google Fit records and syncs data from Android sensors and connected wearables in the background in a battery-efficient way, freeing your app from long-running services, databases, and backend servers.  Users own their data and can share it with apps of their choice -- including yours -- to make their data work harder for them.  What will you build with Google Fit?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hS8OLV-D1lw/default.jpg,2014-10-28

In this DevByte, we'll walk through authorizing your developer account in the Google Developer Console, connecting to Google Play Services in your Android app, and using the Sensors API to collect and display data.  The Sensors API can list and subscribe to data from sensors on the user's phone or tablet as well as any connected devices, like Android Wear.  By registering or unregistering a listener, your app can receive real-time updates of fitness data and provide immediate feedback to users.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jwaQaWGLlTo/default.jpg,2014-10-28

They can either create rich and compelling experiences that help users understand and use the application, or they can demonstrate just how truly awful the performance of your application is as they stutter and jank all over the screen. ""Turn it off! Turn it off!"" your users will scream. But there's a better way. Graphics performance is at the heart of smooth and seamless animations: optimize your rendering performance and you can turn your users on instead of having them turn you off.

3009,3Bq521dIjCM,The Pursuit of 60fps Everywhere with Nat Duca,"Nat Duca is an engineer on the Chrome team working to make an always-60fps, jank free mobile web a reality.

If you want to move something at 60fps today, you must apply a littany of tricks, especially translateZ and friends. If you make a mistake, off the fast path ye shall go. On the Chrome team we think this sucks. Throughout the last year, we've been digging through examples of mobile UIs built with web technology, hunting down bottlenecks and trying to soften up these fast paths so easy, simple effects hit 60fps without breaking a sweat. We envision a world where, just as JS speed improvements killed the ""which is faster, whiles or for loops"" question, that the intuitive HTML way to do an effect can also reliably hit 60fps. In the talk, we'll share what we've learned so far (lots!), what we're doing about it (stuff!), and where we'd like to go next in pursuit of this vision.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3Bq521dIjCM/default.jpg,2014-09-03

Outside of Google, Addy enjoys both hacking on open-source projects like TodoMVC and Grunt-UnCSS. He has authored books on JavaScript design patterns and frameworks. 

Efficient JavaScript webapps need to be fluid and fast. Any app with significant user interaction needs to consider how to effectively keep memory usage down because if too much is consumed, a page might be killed, forcing the user to reload it and cry in a corner. Automatic garbage collection isn't a substitute for effective memory management, especially in large, long-running web apps. In this talk we'll walk through how to master the Chrome DevTools for effective memory management.

For the most part those days are dead, and have been replaced with web pages that stay in constant communication with the server. The implications have changed the landscape of how to optimally build performant websites. Node.js can be one of the most powerful tools in this new world, but only if used wisely. We'll cover how to optimally handle large numbers of connections and the best ways to rapidly send many smaller packets to the client, what trade-offs there are, and expose when immediately streaming data is actually slower.

e.g., the BarcodeDecoder, the KoopaPhysicsEngine, the AudioStreamer, etc. These classes all have dependencies; perhaps a BarcodeCameraFinder, DefaultPhysicsEngine, and an HttpStreamer.  In contrast, the worst classes in any application are the ones that take up space without doing much at all, e.g., the BarcodeDecoderFactory, the CameraServiceLoader, and the MutableContextWrapper. These classes are the clumsy duct tape that wires the interesting stuff together.

Dagger is a very fast and simple replacement for these FactoryFactory
classes. It allows you to focus on the interesting classes.  You just simply declare dependencies, specify how to satisfy them, and ship your app.

Dagger is a joint effort between Google and Square with some individual contributors from other places such as Netflix.  It is descended conceptually from another project used widely within Google called Guice, which despite its popularity was not without issues.

This is the story of another small group of engineers attempting to evolve and improve DI forward yet again with Dagger: a dramatically different reimplementation using generated code.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oK_XtfXPkqw/default.jpg,2014-08-21

We all strive to create the perfect engaging design that users will like‚Äîultimately love‚Äîand want to use over and over and never abandon. Sounds like a love story? It sure is. Why? This is because our users actually do fall in love with great applications as a result of subconscious mating patterns when they interact with the applications we distribute. This is what makes these application so easy to distribute among users. So, if you want to design an app which will be easily distributed, you must understand the relationship between humans and apps. In this presentation, you will be introduced to a framework for creating applications that are both attractive and appealing and therefore, distributable. You will learn some tips on how to design apps that will instantly catch the user's attention‚Äîcall it love at first sight, be fun to use and be less prone to be abandoned.

Jennifer Gove

Description:
Many websites still provide a poor experience on mobile, and so we wanted to develop an in-depth understanding of what differentiates a great and an inferior mobile experience. Our work has resulted in the development of a set of user experience principles for mobile website design. The principles illustrate how to create experiences that support conversion on mobile, whether that be for a purchase, a quote or a lead. The principles have been developed out of a study that Google User Experience Research conducted in partnership with AnswerLab - a user research consultancy. We studied 100 sites with diversity across size and vertical, and held 119 in-person, one-hour usability sessions with Android and iOS smartphone users. We instructed participants to perform key conversion-focused tasks, such as purchasing an item, booking a reservation, or researching plans or prices.  This presentation will illustrate key principles for designing a better mobile web.

Description:
It doesn't matter if you're writing a multiplayer Android game, or a simple to-do app, your users are increasingly expanding multi-device access from anywhere.    However, sharing state from highscore lists to to-do lists between devices in a way that works well with spotty network connections is hard, error prone and expensive.   Wouldn't it be great if Google took care of all that, while providing an easy path to expand as your app grows and matures?   
In this session, we will show you how to build mobile apps which use new Google technology to simplify data storage, online/offline behavior and synchronization across multiple devices. You'll have full access to the data you store in the Google Cloud platform with app development features and the rich set of data analytics tools to get more use out of your data.

Description:
Satellites have been systematically collecting imagery of our changing planet for more than 40 years, yet until recently this treasure trove of ""big data"" has not been online and available for high-performance data mining.   This session will cover the new Google Earth Engine technology and experimental API for massively-parallel geospatial analysis on daily-updating global datasets such as Landsat satellite imagery.  Scientists and other domain experts are developing new EE-powered applications which map, measure and monitor our changing planet in unprecedented detail, for the benefit of people and the environment.  Applications include tracking and reducing global deforestation; mapping and mitigating the risks of earthquakes and extreme weather events such as floods and drought; and even creating new kinds of geo-visualizations such as the 2014 Webby award-winning ""Timelapse"" - a zoomable, browsable HTML5 video animation of the entire Earth from 1984-2012, built from nearly a petabyte of Landsat data. These early results merely hint at what's now possible.

Tomer Sharon

Description:
App developers ask themselves excellent questions about their users: Do people need my app? Can people use my app? Why do people sign up and then not use my app? However, app developers answer their excellent questions in invalid and unreliable ways. It is shocking to see how much effort app developers put in writing elegantly structured, refactored code, with good unit test coverage in an agile environment, and yet, their apps fail miserably. 
This talk will inspire developers to implement valid and reliable ways to answer their most burning questions. It'll help them validate or invalidate their assumptions on their own‚Äîcheaply, and quickly, by using simple user research techniques with a main goal in mind: developing apps people need, want, and enjoy.

3155,Y0Z58YQSXv0,"Google I/O 2014 - Big data, the Cloud way: Accelerated and simplified","Speaker(s):
William Vambenepe

Description:
Making sense of your Big Data problems doesn't have to require a herculean effort. Deriving meaning from your data, at any scale, doesn't have to involve a tangle of clusters, configurations, and scripts that takes a team of specialized administrators to unravel. In fact, you can make it manageable and easy for all developers without losing insight in the process. We've created easy-to-use services so that you can run deep analytics on both streaming and historical data with as little effort as hosting an app on App Engine. 
However, sometimes, you need more control and configurability than managed services allow. That doesn't mean that you lose all the benefits of the Big Data tools that Google Cloud Platform has developed. You can easily combine managed services, where it makes sense, with Open Source tools like Hadoop and Spark. This session will dive into what you can use today to manage Big Data like Google itself does, ""the Cloud way"", as well as how you can plan to scale as your data needs shift and mature.

3156,DKUxrZED_0s,Google I/O 2014 - Going responsive with the Google Play Apps Suite,"Speaker(s):
Kirill Grouchnikov, Marco Paglia

Description:
The Google Play apps suite started as five separate projects -- Play Store, Play Music, Play Books, Play Movies and Play Magazines -- each with its own visual style and presence on devices and the web. Through 2013 and 2014 we worked to bring these together under a single design and common brand, with a unified experience across multiple screens and devices.

In this session we'll look at the Play design to see how it scales along two key vectors: consistency across tasks such as exploring, purchasing and consuming digital content; and consistency across a broad spectrum of screens, from phones to tablets to the web on 30"""" desktop monitors. We'll highlight the cards and clusters that organize content and look at the building blocks that let us implement a responsive design. Join us to hear why we set out on this journey and what we've learned along the way.

3160,MG_nOddk01E,Google I/O 2014 - Biologically inspired models of intelligence,"Speaker(s):
Ray Kurzweil

Description:
For decades Ray Kurzweil has explored how artificial intelligence can enrich and expand human capabilities. In his latest book, How To Create A Mind, he takes this exploration to the next step: reverse-engineering the brain to understand precisely how it works, then applying that knowledge to create intelligent machines. In the near term, Ray's project at Google is developing artificial intelligence based on biologically inspired models of the neocortex to enhance functions such as search, answering questions, interacting with the user, and language translation. The goal is to understand natural language to communicate with the user as well as to understand the meaning of web documents and books. In the long term, Ray believes it is only by extending our minds with our intelligent technology that we can overcome humanity's grand challenges.

Timothy Jordan

Description:
Wearable computing is here and the way we interact with technology will be completely different.  Building cool, fun, and delightful experiences is no longer enough.  They must also be experiences that address specific user problems and never get in the way or take precedence over the user's life.  They must give users all the benefits of technology they've come to expect, and more, while meeting them on their terms in a seamless and intrinsically human way.
In this session, we'll take a look at the constellation of devices that make up not just wearable, but ubiquitous computing.  We'll tie them all together with common design and development practices as well as the Google Platform.  This is the key information that'll get you ready for being part of a sea change of technology that invariably puts the user first.

3163,isYZXwaP3Q4,Google I/O 2014 - Material design principles,"Speaker(s):
Christian Robertson, Jon Wiley, Jonathan Lee, Matias Duarte, Nicholas Jitkoff

Formerly titled ""Cross-platform design""

Design is the art of considered creation. As designers, our goal is to satisfy the diverse spectrum of human needs. As those needs evolve, so too must our designs, practices, and philosophies.

We challenged ourselves to create a visual language for our users that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science. The result is material design: a cross-platform design system grounded in tactile reality, inspired by our study of paper and ink, yet open to imagination and magic.

In this session, design leads across Google discuss the key principles of material design, and set the stage for the later sessions focusing on interaction, motion and visual design.

Steve has used both ground overlays (http://goo.gl/JnRZOk) and tile overlays (http://goo.gl/QgMiYK) in this app. Animated ground overlays display the weather patterns overlaid on the map. And Steve uses a tile overlay to tone down the map styling and remove the map labels, giving a nice clean background for the weather data. Steve's app is an open source project, available on GitHub: https://github.com/sjg/Synoptic.

It follows this general outline:

1.) Download the Hello Endpoints Java Backend API (http://goo.gl/ndv97M) and start it locally.

2.) Generate an Android-compatible client library for the Backend API.

3.) Setup a basic Android project that has a simple UI.

4.) Add the generated client library and dependencies to the Android project.

5.) Add code that uses the client library in Android.

6.) Test code in an Android emulator.

Make sure to have Maven 3.1+, Git, and Android Studio installed, operational, and updated before attempting to follow the steps in the video.

Full Sample Code can be accessed at this URL: http://goo.gl/Ab8R6r

For a safer Javascript origin, I recommend personalizing your URL with:

3745,QVnN34YGz8s,Google Summer of Code,"Google Summer of Code is a global program that offers student
developers stipends to write code for various open source software
projects. We work with many open source, free software, and
technology-related groups to identify and fund projects over a three
month period. Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought
together over 7,500 successful student participants from 97 countries
and over 7,000 mentors from over 100 countries worldwide to produce
over 50 million lines of code. Through Google Summer of Code, accepted
student applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the
participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software
development scenarios and the opportunity for employment in areas
related to their academic pursuits. In turn, the participating
projects are able to more easily identify and bring in new developers.
Best of all, more source code is created and released for the use and
benefit of all.

3985,O5az5D51ACQ,Waterfall Antipatterns,"Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/jrvis/gdl-waterfall-anti-patterns
You've been asked to investigate why your web site is loading slowly. You've heard of WebPagetest.org so you enter the URL and run a test. What appears next is a colorful chart that looks like a Dr. Seuss illustration. Some bars are long, some are short. Some bars are blue, some are green. ""That's nice,"" you say to yourself, wondering what to do next. It looks benign, innocently simple. But you know it holds many secrets.

The waterfall chart is a mysterious force to some developers. Performance gurus seem to be able to divine the ailments of a slow site at one quick glance. ""But how?"" you wonder. The reality is that anyone can read a waterfall chart - if they know that they're looking for.

In this presentation, YouTube web developer Rick Viscomi will help you to identify specific patterns in a waterfall chart, patterns which are the signs of a slow site. Using these newfound skills, you will become that performance guru and everyone will rejoice.Ôªø",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O5az5D51ACQ/default.jpg,2013-06-13

Blink and WebKit use a compositor to display web contents to the user's screen. But how do we take a render tree (the browser's internal representation of a web page) and display it using a compositor? How do we decide what content should have a separate compositing layer, and how does compositing benefit us?  In this presentation, Chrome software engineer Shawn Singh will introduce basic concepts of compositing, and then we will focus on how Blink bridges the gap between the render tree and the compositor. This is only a slice of the overall rendering architecture, but it will be fun and insightful for any web developers and browser developers with an interest in how Blink and WebKit render web pages.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lpk1dYdo62o/default.jpg,2013-05-22

4119,d3kfEeMZ65c,Google I/O 2013 - High Performance Audio,"Glenn Kasten, Ian Ni-Lewis, Raph Levien 

It'¬Ä¬ôs not that hard to play a background soundtrack in your mobile game app, or to play short clips of sound in response to user actions. But how about responsive reliable audio, that doesn'¬Ä¬ôt glitch, works well across a range of devices, and doesn'¬Ä¬ôt eat up your user's battery? Oh, and is lower latency too? It turns out that's not so easy. We'¬Ä¬ôll share our own experiences with the Android platform and apps, discuss the problem areas and the work we√¢¬Ä¬ôve been doing in the platform, and give some techniques you can apply now in your own apps. We assume you'¬Ä¬ôre familiar with OpenSL ES and audio terminology.

Research at Google is unique, as it is conducted across the entire Engineering organization - by Research Scientists as well as Software Engineers.  Teams are integrated, boundaries are fluid, and we face challenges together while retaining a close feedback loop from our users. This enables us to quickly build, iterate, and launch new and innovative products that change the state of the art and thereby produce new research results.  Google's definition of research is broad and happens in multiple ways across the organization.  Our research results in technology advances in the areas of Audio/Video Fingerprinting, Image Understanding, MapReduce/Parallel Computing, Deep Learning, and Parsing at Scale, which we apply to many of our products.  And, it also results in new whole new products, such as Voice Search and Google Translate. Learn about Google's hybrid approach to research from the engineers and scientists behind ideas such as Google Glass, MapReduce, Search, and online education, who conduct big idea experiments that translate into real-time innovation at Google.

In 2009, Ray Ryan gave a talk at Google I/O advocating the Model-View-Presenter pattern and the EventBus for architecting GWT applications. Since then, MVP and the EventBus have become widespread in the GWT community and several frameworks have appeared to support them. However, there's still a lot of confusion over what MVP actually is and the best way to implement it. Many common solutions involve tedious amounts of boilerplate and overhead. In this talk, I will demonstrate that using MVP and the EventBus correctly is easier than you probably think it is and can be done without any frameworks or extra overhead. The end result is a more testable, maintainable GWT application that is a pleasure to work with.

This video is an edited version of a recorded YouTube API tech talk held on Feb 16th, 2013 in the Tokyo Google office. 

One billion unique users visit YouTube each month, and 4B hours of video are watched per month on YouTube.

You can take advantage of this large audience to promote your game by adding the YouTube APIs directly into your game. 

In this session, we discuss integrating the YouTube APIs into mobile, PC, and console games. We also demo actual games that have already done the integration (along with some fun videos)!

To do this, I've built a sample application that uses both GWT and Dart. I'll show you how to setup a development environment so that you can work with both technologies. Then, I'll show you a variety of ways in which you can get GWT and Dart to interoperate.

4467,22n06z0rq4c,Task Queue Basics,"This lesson presents an overview and inner workings of the Task Queue.

The task queue has two flavors: push queue and pull queue. The push queue is a great way to schedule a unit of work, such as sending an e-mail, outside of a user request. This prevents blocking the user request while the e-mail is enqueued for delivery. Push tasks are treated as normal http requests, and are executed ASAP on the same app engine application.

The pull queue allows enqueuing tasks that can be leased by workers according to user defined logic. Unlike push tasks, pull tasks are pieces of data that can be accessed from other app engine instances, servers, or external servers.

Learn how to use both push and pull queues as well as fine tune configuration to optimize performance. Also learn how to execute push tasks on a regular schedule using cron jobs.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/22n06z0rq4c/default.jpg,2013-02-05

3. Google Apps for Business

Un tema relativamente nuevo en el mundo empresarial en nuestra regi√≥n es la nube y c√≥mo aprovecharla mejor. Google Apps for Business es un servicio basado en la nube que provee Mensajer√≠a y Colaboraci√≥n a trav√©s de los productos que todos conocemos de Google pero con el nivel de controles y auditor√≠a que requieren las empresas. El enfoque de Google es y siempre ha sido la satisfacci√≥n de nuestros usuarios y Google Apps for Business le permite a las empresas transformar su forma de trabajo, innovar y colaborar en tiempo real, al tiempo que las prepara para la llegada de las nuevas generaciones.

Migrar a Google Apps for Business es muy f√°cil, empresas chicas lo hacen en semanas y grandes en cuesti√≥n de pocos meses. Con Google Apps te olvidas de ciclos largos de productos, esperas tortuosas y dif√≠ciles negociaciones para acceder a lo √∫ltimo. Cada a√±o se hacen cientos de mejoras a la plataforma y lo √∫nico que se requiere es hacer un refresh en el navegador, todos est√°n en la versi√≥n NOW.

Con m√°s de 4 millones de empresas en Google Apps for Business y 5 mil sum√°ndose cada d√≠a, existe un mercado interesant√≠simo abierto para los desarrolladores. Imaginen todo lo que se puede crear en App Engine, Apps Script y Android para el mercado empresarial, que se puede promocionar y distribuir desde el Apps Marketplace. Para mayor informaci√≥n sobre Google Apps for Business, consulta www.google.com/a.

Join us on Wednesday November 14th for our Monthly Mobile Web Hangout! This month Brad Frost will be joining us to talk about responsive design versus separate mobile sites.  Although the US presidential race is already decided, the candidates spent a lot of time intensely debating the country's hot-button issues. The web design world is entrenched in our own debate about how to address the mobile web: should we create a separate mobile site or create a responsive experience instead?

It just so happens that the two US presidential candidates have picked different mobile web strategies for their official websites. In the red corner is Republican candidate Mitt Romney's dedicated mobile site, while in the blue corner is incumbent president Barack Obama's responsive website. Sit back, crack open a cold one, and watch the battle unfold as Brad dissect the candidates' sites to uncover best practices and common mobile web pitfalls.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SVPJcw5-WNc/default.jpg,2012-11-14

Bob Nystrom, engineer on the Dart project, presents an encore session of his OSCON 2012 talk about the Dart project.

Abstract:

When we announced Dart, it kicked up a bit of a dust storm. In this talk, I discuss the challenges that Google and others face when building web apps today. I introduce Dart and show how its features were designed specifically to address some of those challenges.

You'll see how Dart protects you from many of the dark corners and sharp edges of JavaScript and the DOM. When your programs grow and evolve over time, you'll see how Dart can help keep your app nimble and maintainable. Thanks to Dart's Dart to JavaScript compiler, you'll see how you get all of that while still being able to run on any browser that supports modern JS and without the bad karma of fracturing the web.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9RCuW6K1afs/default.jpg,2012-07-24

Google App Engine is a unique hosting platform that lets you build applications and run them in Google's data centers using the massive global infrastructure built to run the Internet giant. App Engine offers a development environment that uses familiar technologies (Java and Python) and provides a powerful and robust set of APIs to users while maintaining security and independence from other apps running in the cloud. 


It is always free to get started so you can try it out with no risk, and if you need additional computing resources, you can purchase additional computing resources beyond the free quota limits. Scale your 
application to millions of users and pay only for what you use at more competitive market pricing!

In this informative session, we review cloud computing as an industry and where Google App Engine fits into the picture. Specifically, we discuss App Engine as a PaaS solution because of the inherent challenges of building web and other applications. We'll outline the architecture of App Engine, what its major components are, introduce its features and APIs, discuss the service and how it works (including information on the free quotas), and finally present some information about current users and usage, including integration with Google Apps and your private corporate data.

Also be sure to attend the hands-on workshops where you'll build real apps and run locally and/or in 
production -- upload your app to Google and make it live to the world!""",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6TZ0e57pdZQ/default.jpg,2011-05-12

Google is expanding our storage products by introducing Google Storage for Developers. It offers a RESTful API for storing and accessing data at Google. Developers can take advantage of the performance and reliability of Google's storage infrastructure, as well as the advanced security and sharing capabilities. We will demonstrate key functionality of the product as well as customer use cases. Google relies heavily on data analysis and has developed many tools to understand large datasets. Two of these tools are now available on a limited sign-up basis to developers: (1) BigQuery: interactive analysis of very large data sets and (2) Prediction API: make informed predictions from your data. We will demonstrate their use and give instructions on how to get access.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CZHAnZ8WahA/default.jpg,2010-12-14

Gemalto is using GWT to build a smartcard management app: they built a browser plugin that exposes the smartcard reader API to the developer in javascript, then developed a GWT library to use this API from a GWT app.
One innovative aspect of the app is that you can run it from a server, or as a desktop app, where you just run the javascript and html from the local file system.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uPzuILcsERk/default.jpg,2010-03-27

Daniel Wilkerson

Massively scalable web applications encounter a fundamental tension in computing between performance and correctness: whereas performance is often addressed by using a large and therefore distributed machine, correctness, especially of an interruptible and multi-threaded program, requires data invariants to be maintained with the assistance of an underlying transaction layer. We provide a Distributed Transaction algorithm assuming a strongly consistent layer providing Local Transactions. We give most of the detail for operation in optimistic mode; however the same infrastructure could be used for pessimistic transactions as well, even at the same time. The algorithm is general but we express it in the particular instance of Google App Engine.

Casey Whitelaw, Dan Danilatos, Alex Mah, David Wang

We will explore the technology stack underlying Google Wave, from the bottom up. Google Wave's real-time collaboration is based on operational transformation algorithms, which we extended to support our data model of structured data and annotations. Our AJAX editor renders wave content and sends and receives fine-grained changes down to the level of keystrokes. Our context-sensitive spelling system shows how this stack enables new kinds of interactivity.

Creating relatively simple applications that scale with App Engine can be easy after the initial learning curve. But larger applications with more complex functionality are still hard to get right, especially when you need to scale. This talk will go over more advanced data structures and techniques to use when building complex web applications with Google App Engine, and how to make them scale.

If you work on distributed systems, you try to design your system to keep running if any single machine fails. If you're ambitious, you might extend this to entire racks, or even more inconvenient sets of machines. However, what if your entire datacenter falls off the face of the earth?  This talk will examine how current large scale storage systems handle fault tolerance and consistency, with a particular focus on the App Engine datastore. We'll cover techniques such as replication, sharding, two phase commit, and consensus protocols (e.g. Paxos), then explore how they can be applied across datacenters.

Ola Bini

JRuby is regarded as the most stable and efficient implementation of Ruby. Running JRuby on top of Google App Engine for Java gives access to many interesting possibilities, including running Rails on top of Google's infrastructure. Exactly how to make this happen is not totally apparent, though, and there are several gotchas involved in the process. This presentation will introduce the pieces of JRuby needed to get everything working, what kind of customizations are needed, what you might need to avoid in Ruby to avoid getting in trouble with App Engine's security restrictions, and many other things. It will also look at how to test your Rails application, and how you can interface Ruby with Google's Datastore service. And JRuby isn't the only dynamic language that can be run on top of App Engine, using the new Java stack. Ioke is a small, prototype based object oriented language that also runs on App Engine. This part of the presentation introduces the things that you as a language implementor might need to keep in mind to make sure that your JVM language can run on top of App Engine.

Enterprise software pundits are now gazing metaphorically skyward. There's all this talk of clouds, but what kind of clouds are coming, and will they be friendly? We begin by describing some applications we've developed for App Engine, including implementation of other languages, such as JRuby, on top of the App Engine for Java implementation. These implementations demonstrate the breadth of capability provided by App Engine. We then examine some of the strengths and current weaknesses that we encountered. We also describe more about the implications for testing that arise when developing on App Engine. We will also present an initial framework for characterizing these differnet clouds and examine how these characteristics will impact the adoption path for enterprises and the kinds of applications these enterprises will move to the cloud. Of particular interest here is the central role of Big Table in App Engine. Broad adoption of this of this platform could lead to lots of lightening striking at the dominant role relational data base systems currently enjoy.

Max Ross

Google App Engine is a powerful cloud-computing platform designed to help developers more easily create and manage scalable web applications. With the recent addition of Java support, developers can now interact with the Google App Engine datastore using JDO and JPA, both standard Java persistence APIs. In this talk we will discuss how these standards allow you to create a ""soft schema"" on top of a schema-less datastore, and the advantages this soft schema provides. We will also explore how the datastore's ""pre-sharded"" transactional model is exposed in these standard interfaces. Finally, we will discuss how a soft schema maps to a traditional, relational schema, and examine some techniques for porting persistence code on and off App Engine.

Jeff Ragusa, Daniel Jefferies

The popularity of Google Apps as a suite of business tools is creating new revenue opportunities for IT service providers, systems integrators, and freelance consultants.  Traditional value-added resellers are looking for ways to adapt their business for the world of cloud computing and the new Google Apps Authorized Reseller program provides the perfect framework for moving a services business in this direction.  In this session we'll look at revenue opportunities for partners in this area ranging from assisting with SaaS product selection, to guidance on best practices, to custom application development, deployment & integration work, and managed services.  We'll look at how the reseller program can enable service providers to take advantage of these opportunities through marketing, sales and technical tools and resources.  We'll also hear from one of Google's early resellers, Newmind Group, on their experiences, challenges, and successes.

Robert Kroeger

Puzzled by all the new architectural choices possible when trying to build an offline-capable web application? So were we until we decided to design the newly launched Gmail Mobile Web for iPhone and Android's offline capabilities by analogy with microprocessor caches: offline via a portable write-through caching layer running on either HTML 5 or Gears databases.

Dan Morrill

The primary way to develop apps for Android is using managed code that runs in the Dalvik virtual machine. Yet, Android also includes a super-modern Browser that includes Gears. It's even possible to build parts of your apps in native code (that is, C.) Choice is good, but it does mean one more decision for the developer to make -- and in this case, a big decision. Should you write your app in managed code, to integrate cleanly and seamlessly with the system? Should you write your app in the Browser as ""Ajax plus"", so that it can run on multiple phone platforms? Or should you go for raw speed, and write part of it in ARM-processor native code? There's no universal answer to these questions, but in this session Dan Morrill will teach you to pick the technique that works best for your app. In this session, you'll get a demonstration of each technique, and learn how to apply them to your own apps.

5752,j7y9mqy8X2Y,Developer Profiles - Paul Hammant (ThoughtWorks) on AppEngine,"Last week we had a number of exciting announcements at Campfire One (http://code.google.com/campfire/). We've received a lot of good feedback so far. We've heard from developers who were excited about cron support, intrigued by the Google Secure Data Connector and pleased with database import. However, most of the excitement has been reserved for the new integrated development environment which was created through the marriage of Google-Web-Toolkit (GWT), Google App Engine for Java and the Google Plugin for Eclipse. Web app developers can now not only write both client and server code using the familiar Java language, but they can share & reuse code between client and server.

I wanted to capture some real world developer feedback, so as part of our Developer Profiles series I sat down with Paul Hammant of ThoughtWorks to discuss his first impressions with the platform. As Paul continues to tinker with the platform you can of course follow him on his blog.

If you have a compelling application that you've written with Google App Engine and GWT I'd like to hear about it. Send me an email at fredsa@google.com.

5769,rp2o8IwWBbQ,A Tour of Glacier Data Sets via Google Earth and GeoServer,"Two widely used glacier data sets are the World Glacier Inventory (WGI) and the Glacier Photograph Collection (GPC). Both data sets are available from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The WGI encompasses over 100,000 records of glacier data and the GPC houses approximately 10,000 digitized photographs. The online GPC has doubled in size this year due to significant updates from the USGS Ice and Climate Project collection and also many contributions by Austin Post.
These updates bring photographs from the past to the forefront by enabling users to view Alaskan glaciers from the 1960s through the
1990s. The GPC KML files are updated intermittently. Because the WGI contains over 100,000 data records, a PostgreSQL database with a PostGIS extension was selected to store the data. GeoServer, an open source server, supports PostGIS and produces KML output automatically. By facilitating access to the KML files, data users can locate their region of interest and search for glacier data in a spatial context. The KML files are presented in Google Earth.

Python is a popular very-high-level programming language, with a clean and spare syntax, simple and regular semantics, a large standard library and a wealth of third-party extensions, libraries and tools. With several production-quality open-source implementations available, many excellent books, and growing acceptance in both industry and academia, Python can play some useful role within a huge variety of software development projects.

Moreover, Python is really easy to learn, particularly (though not exclusively) for programmers who are skilled at such languages as Java, C++ and C. This talk addresses software developers who are experienced in other languages but have had limited or no exposure to Python yet, and offers a rapid overview of the main characteristics of the language, plus a brief synopsis of its main implementations, its standard library, and Python's use with Google App Engine.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bDgD9whDfEY/default.jpg,2008-06-11

Bruce Johnson (Google)

You may already know about GWT's nifty JavaScript Native Interface (JSNI), which allows you to define native Java methods with handwritten JavaScript. In GWT 1.5, there's an even more powerful way to program close to the metal. You can now model arbitrary JavaScript types directly as Java classes (specifically, as subclasses of GWT's JavaScriptObject class), yet there is no overhead in size or speed. You can code against any JavaScript object as if it were a regular old Java object. So, what does that buy you?

* It's never been easier to integrate with external JS libraries; just define a Java class that models the JS object you want to interact with. Nice Java syntax, no overhead.
* Freely use low-level native JS data structures (JS arrays, for example) by exposing them with a Java-friendly API. You can even apply Java generics to JS types!
* Superimpose strongly-typed Java classes on JSON objects, giving you IDE code completion, refactoring and compile-time type checking.
* GWT uses this new ability to provide a complete cross-browser DOM class hierarchy based on the W3C's Java HTML bindings. Programming straight to the DOM has never been more productive.

Come learn about this unusual and powerful new capability that you can use to squeeze every drop of performance and interop out of your GWT projects.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vv2MnqP8Bmk/default.jpg,2008-06-10

Bruce Johnson (Google)

What do you do when you want the benefits of modularity and abstraction during development, but you aren't willing to subject users with any runtime overhead to get it? If you're the GWT team, you invent deferred binding. Deferred binding is a pluggable compile-time type substitution and code generation mechanism. This unique approach to program modularization provides many of the benefits of Java reflection and dynamic class loading without compromising the GWT compiler's ability to optimize the heck out of your code.

In this Code Lab, we'll examine how the GWT libraries leverage deferred binding and GWT compiler optimizations to provide zero-overhead browser abstractions, highly optimized internationalization, automatic image bundling, and high-performance, polymorphic RPC. Did we mention that deferred binding is extensible? We'll also use deferred binding to create a new library from scratch.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nvti32k4xyU/default.jpg,2008-06-10

How do we now push the envelope with respect
to Web applications and adaptive technologies such as screenreaders and self-voicing browsers in a manner similar to what we as Web developers have collectively achieved for the mainstream user?

Alex Russell (SitePen)

HTML, HTTP, JavaScript, CSS and most of the web development stack have been often cited as proof that ""worse is better"", but today divergent views of the web are emerging as we find out that that worse isn't *always* better, that ubiquity and openness are assailable advantages, and that the web's derivative value streams already are routing around the flaws in HTML's semantics.

This talk looks at the divergent views being fielded today. GWT, Flex, and Silverlight all take the view that the web is a problem to be fixed, giving developers serious power to accomplish more in less time. The other view, embodied by Safari, HTML 5, Gears, and Ajax libraries like Dojo suggests that there is an evolutionary path which still provides a place for upgrades to existing semantics and practice.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nG66hIhUdEU/default.jpg,2008-06-10

Alex Moffat and Damon Lundin (Lombardi)

Lombardi Blueprint is a browser based business process documentation and diagramming tool written using GWT and Java. It supports simultaneous viewing and editing of process definitions by multiple users in different locations with multi level undo and a rich editing experience including drag and drop, inline editing and, automatic diagram layout. Implementing these features presented several technical challenges.

Damon and Alex will describe two of the most interesting: 1) synchronizing multiple client object models with the server, and 2) providing a highly responsive diagram editing experience.

Creating a complex user interface poses particular performance problems using today's javascript engines over what can typically be performed with a native Java VM. The two main challenges we faced with our process diagram were speed of rendering in the browser and automatically laying out and routing large diagrams. Efficient rendering requires us to use a flyweight pattern to handle large html documents, while layout and routing dynamically switches between client and server execution depending on the time required to layout the diagram.

To support multi user editing and viewing Blueprint must keep client and server object models in sync. Our repository design supports doing this efficiently by only requiring us to transfer the differences between two model states in either direction. This same approach allows us also to support rollback to previously saved versions by having the server compute the set of commands required to move between any two states.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xh5Vo_drhDE/default.jpg,2008-06-09

Patrick Chanezon, Kevin Marks, Chris Schalk (Google)

OpenSocial is an open specification defining a common API that works on many different social websites, including MySpace, Plaxo, Hi5, Ning, orkut, Salesforce.com and LinkedIn, among others. This allows developers to learn one API, then write a social application for any of those sites: Learn once, write anywhere.

In addition, in order to make it easier for developers of social sites to implement the API and make their site an OpenSocial container, the Apache project Shindig provides reference implementations for OpenSocial containers in several languages (Java, PHP). Shindig will define a language specific Service Provider Interface (SPI) that a social site can implement to connect Shindig to People, Persistence and Activities backend services for the social site. Shindig will then expose these services as OpenSocial Javascript and REST APIs.

In this session we will explain what OpenSocial is, show examples of OpenSocial containers and applications, demonstrate how to create an OpenSocial application, and explain how to leverage Apache Shindig in order to implement an OpenSocial container.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ila8j1cvnWk/default.jpg,2008-05-29
